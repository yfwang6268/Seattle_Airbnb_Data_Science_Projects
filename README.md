- Seattle.zip: the data file download from Kaggle. Inside the zip file, there are three data files as below
    - calendar.csv: including listing id and the price and availability for that day; 1.39m rows * 4 columns
    - listing.csv: including full descriptions and average review score; 3,819 rows * 92 columns
    - reviews.csv: including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments; 84.8k rows * 6 columns
    
## Run the project:

Assumption: Python and Jupyter notebook are installed

- Download the main file 'p1_data_science_blog.ipynb' and 'Seattle.zip'
- Unzip 'Seattle.zip' into the local enviornment
- open 'p1_data_science_blog.ipynb' and run the file in above same enviornment
